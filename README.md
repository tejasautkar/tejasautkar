### Hi there 👋

### I am Tejas Autkar,


🔭 I’m currently working on an itinerary web app and a chat application with authentication, authorization and session management.
- 🌱 Although I have been working as a MEAN stack (typescript) developer for more than a year now, I am dabbling with ReactJS and also making my backend fundamentals strong.
- 💬 Ask me about Typescript, NodeJS, Design Patterns in javascript.
- 🏔️ I like mountains and listening to good English and Hindi music. We can always talk about Hip-Hop.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on good typescript/javascript projects.
